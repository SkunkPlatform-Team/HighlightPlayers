## How can I evaluate it with a Roblox script?

To evaluate the script in Roblox using a URL, follow these steps:

1. Inject your Client-Side Executor or open the Developer Console.
2. Use the example usage for evaluating with the URL:
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SkunkPlatform-Team/HighlightPlayers/refs/heads/main/bin/main.lua?token=GHSAT0AAAAAAC3QCX5T7EJJJFAU6WEXNDFEZ3MEGVQ"))()
-- Ensure you are the owner of the game or using an executor on the client side.
```
3. Execute your Client-Side Executor or Developer Console.

The example usage will work. If you have any questions or issues, try contacting SkunkPlatform's Contact Channel: [SkunkPlatform's Channel](https://skunkplatform.netlify.app/messages/channels?channel=-OE1Dt_ta4Q4Api_oIoZ)
